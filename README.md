# CS-330-Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

<b>• How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to
craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future
work?</b>

While not a new skill, I feel working on this project has helped me refine modularizing
my code. Not only does that make coding easier to work on and debug, but it also
makes it easier to understand from an outside perspective. Using a modularized
approach was extremely beneficial when designing and testing the objects in the 3D
scene.


<b>• How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your
3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the
milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?</b>

Working on this project has reinforced the idea of running the code whenever you can,
as it can be an excellent method to help steer you in the right direction. Especially when
working with graphics and animations, it is important to see what the changes made do
when running.


<b>• How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new
knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational
pathway?</b>


Working with OpenGL was an eye opener for me. The concepts were difficult for me at
first and made me realize that I’ve ignored working with graphics and visualization for
too long. I’d like work more with OpenGL so I can truly become familiar with the
concepts of working with visualization.
